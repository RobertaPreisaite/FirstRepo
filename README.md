# Image Dimension Checker
_Image Dimension Checker_ checks if the dimensions specified in an image name are exact as the widgth and height by pixels of an imaged. It also checks the deviation between dimensions specified in image name and actual image dimensions as well as calculates number of images and formats.

## What for?
For everyone who works in a creative or digital marketing agency or anyone who wants to check if image dimensions match dimensions specified in image name (for example, if no pixels were accidentally cut while editing) and who wants to get a quick overview of sent banners.

## Quick start
### Images to test
* Find a folder with images only and remember the directory (you will need to write it down later). If you want to test _Image Dimension Checker_ but do not have images, you can download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yPCU6tsRbDEYgdfdojQCn8ELiIrZiHqS).
* Image name can be random, i. e. you can use blank spaces, underscores, dashes, etc. Dimensions have to be also included in an image name with lower _x_ between width and height and no spaces in between (e.g. _x-mas_tree 1000x1000 2_).
* Save the list of [valid image formats](https://github.com/RobertaPreisaite/FirstRepo/blob/master/ad_formats.txt) in your computer as `.txt`. Remember the path, later you will need to specify it.
